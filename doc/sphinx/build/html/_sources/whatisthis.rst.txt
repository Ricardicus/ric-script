Welcome to Ric-script. This is a project that I am working on, it is a scripting language.
My ambition is to take this to a level where this tool is actually viable sometimes.
I hope it can be interesting to use for whatever anyone might have in mind. Feel free to try it out.
I want to take it to an interesting level.
