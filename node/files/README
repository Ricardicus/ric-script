Welcome esteemed hacker,

I bet you came here to learn more about ric-script.
You can find proper documentation under this domain with
the path /doc (ricardicus.se/doc).

Launch the interpreter with:

$ ric

Under the folder 'samples' you can find ric-script programs
with valid syntax. List them like this:

$ ls samples

Run them like this:

$ ric samples/demo.ric

Happy hacking!

Best,
Rickard Hallerbäck
