# This is where batteries are included

Here I implement functions implemented in the language
by default. I try to make some sort of partitioning
of functionality that makes sense to me. 
There is much that can be included here. 
I basically read arguments from the stack, then
push the return value I deem fit.
If there is anything wrong, a library function
returns a non-zero and the execution of the program
is aborted. In the parent directory there is a file
named [lib.c](https://github.com/Ricardicus/ric-script/blob/master/src/lib.c), in this file I give functions a name
and specify the number of arguments the expect. 

All built in functions are registered there, in the array, but implemented
here.
