# Vim syntax files

I use nvim and these are my configuration files for
ric script! The installation guide below is for nvim,
but the configuration files are valid for vim also.

# Install ric script syntax highlighter

Place the syntax highlighter file syntax/ric.vim to ~/.config/nvim/syntax/ric.vim
and the file detecter to ftdetect/ric.vim to ~/.config/nvim/ftdetect/ric.vim . 

If you are using vim-plug, you can install the ric-script syntax highlighter by inserting
the following line to your run commands file:

```
" ric-script
Plug 'Ricardicus/ric-script.vim'
```
